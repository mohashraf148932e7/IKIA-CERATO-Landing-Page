# IKIA-CERATO-Landing-Page
A landing page designed for IKIA CERATO, a furniture store. Collaborating with the talented designer Yasmeen Kamal, I applied the knowledge I gained from HTML, CSS, UI, and UX courses during my journey at ITI. This project is just the beginning, as I plan to expand it into a comprehensive end-to-end ERP website that addresses real business needs.
